This is a quick hack at syntax highlighting for the OpenSCAD 3D modeling language -- http://www.openscad.org/

Note that at the moment it doesn&#039t help detect errors such as mismatch blocks and parens.

TODOs include error management and auto filetype setup.

I would appreciate feedback and suggestions for improvements, as I am extremely new to OpenSCAD at time of writing.
